# Polyhedrons
To visualize 3D polyhedrons using JavaScript and ThreeJS.

An slightly different version with a more user-friendly interface is available at : [https://download.tuxfamily.org/texgraph/polyedres/polyedres.html](https://download.tuxfamily.org/texgraph/polyedres/polyedres.html "Poly√®dres"). You need to click first on the desired polyhedron picture and then on the WebGL logo to see the 3D polyhedron.

# Use
The main file is under ```js/main.js```. To change the solid, you need to modify lines ```12``` to ```19``` with the appropriate dictionary / index.

With the ```dat.gui``` menu on the upper-left corner of the window, you can change the properties of the displayed polyhedron: rotation velocity, edges color, opacity...
